# SigmASM

Not a full-fledged compiler.

In this project, I have uploaded 2 programs to build a compiler.

One is for lex and parse compiler only.

The other is for a mini compiler capable of handling arithmatics and sigmoid function only.

The projet is under development, and new features will be added.


#  (MY OWN SELF_MADE COMPILER) :
- A small-scale compiler limited to arithematic and sigmoid computing.

- However, it undergoes full stages of the compilation process.

- Hence, the compilation takes time, but the execution is very fast.
 
- The compiler is able to generate intermediate codes and uses the NASM assembler for assembly.

  IF YOU FIND ANY MISTAKES, FEEL FREE TO GUIDE.

    THANK YOU
